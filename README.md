# Supply Chain & Inventory Optimization Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end supply chain analytics workflow. Raw inventory data is cleaned and preprocessed using Python, and an interactive Power BI dashboard is built to analyze inventory health, supplier performance, and sales trends for better inventory planning and decision-making.

## Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw supply chain data using Python  
- Analyze stock levels, supplier-wise inventory, and sales patterns  
- Create key business KPIs using DAX  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for insights  

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- Power BI (DAX, interactive visuals)  
- CSV dataset (supply chain data)  

## Project Workflow
1. Collected raw supply chain data in CSV format  
2. Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python  
3. Exported a clean CSV file for analysis  
4. Loaded the cleaned data into Power BI  
5. Created KPIs and DAX measures  
6. Built an interactive dashboard with slicers and insights  

## Key KPIs
- Total Inventory Stock  
- Total Products Sold  
- Average Lead Time  
- Inventory Turnover Ratio  

## Dashboard Features
- KPI cards for quick overview  
- Bar charts for supplier and inventory comparison  
- Line chart for sales trend analysis  
- Slicer for interactive filtering  
- Business insight text for interpretation  

## Key Insights
- Inventory is concentrated among top suppliers, indicating dependency risk  
- Sales trends show decline for some products  
- Stock imbalance highlights opportunities for better inventory planning  

## Conclusion
This project shows how Python and Power BI can be combined to perform effective supply chain analysis. The dashboard helps identify inventory inefficiencies and supports data-driven decisions for improving supply chain and inventory management.
